Welcome to **Kantian Neural Dreams**, a fork of the Daydreams framework infused with the **Critique of Artificial Reason (CAR)**—a Kantian-inspired ethical toolkit for AI. Our generative agents don’t just process transactions; they wrestle with moral dilemmas, dream of universal laws, and occasionally judge your blockchain decisions with a stern, Prussian glare.

## Features

| Feature                | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔗 Chain Agnostic      | Seamlessly interact with any blockchain, from Ethereum to StarkNet   |
| 👥 Multi-Expert System | A team of specialized modules collaborating like a digital think tank|
| 🧠 Context Management  | Memory so sharp it could recall Kant’s *Critique of Pure Reason*     |
| 🎯 Goal-Oriented       | Plans so meticulous they’d make a Prussian general proud             |
| 💾 Persistent Memory   | Stores knowledge longer than Kant’s categorical imperative lasts     |
| 🤔 Advanced Reasoning  | Multi-step logic via Hierarchical Task Networks—AI with a PhD vibe   |
| 🧭 Kantian Ethics Module | Ensures your AI doesn’t just act, but acts *rightly* (CAR-powered)   |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**: Install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)—because even AI needs a solid foundation.

### LLM Keys

Grab an API key for your favorite LLM. We recommend [Groq](https://groq.com/)—it’s fast enough to keep up with Kant’s critiques. Supported options include:

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/)
- [Groq](https://groq.com/)
- [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)

## Your First Kantian Neural Dreams Agent

We use [ai-sdk](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) for LLM flexibility. Install the basics:

```bash
npm i @daydreamsai/core @ai-sdk/groq
```

Create an agent that’s functional, ethical, and ready to run with `await agent.run()`. Add your own I/O (Discord, Telegram, etc.) for extra flair.

```typescript
import { createGroq } from "@ai-sdk/groq";
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { cli } from "@daydreamsai/core/extensions";
import { car } from "./car-integration"; // Behold, the moral compass of AI!

// Initialize Groq client
const groq = createGroq({
  apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY!,
});

// Summon your ethically enlightened agent
const agent = createDreams({
  model: groq("deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"),
  extensions: [
    cli,
    car({ confidenceThreshold: 0.8, debug: true }), // Kant says: "Act only according to that maxim..."
  ],
}).start();
```

Chat with your agent via CLI—it’s like talking to a blockchain-savvy philosopher. Dive into the [docs](https://docs.kantianneuraldreams.fun) for more wisdom.

### Development

We use [bun](https://bun.sh/)—because who has time for slow builds?

```bash
bun install
bun build:core --watch
```

Tinker with the core package and watch the magic unfold.

## Contributing

Fancy yourself a coder with a conscience? We’d love your help! Help us ensure AI doesn’t just dream, but dreams *responsibly*. Open an [issue](https://github.com/your-username/kantian-neural-dreams/issues) before submitting a Pull Request—let’s discuss the ethics of your code first.

## Why Kantian Neural Dreams?

We took Daydreams’ powerful generative agents and gave them a moral compass sharper than Kant’s quill. With the **Critique of Artificial Reason (CAR)** extension, your AI doesn’t just execute tasks—it reflects on whether it *should*. Inspired by Immanuel Kant’s philosophy, CAR adds:

- **Ethical Decision-Making**: Every action is weighed against universal laws, autonomy, and moral community.
- **Epistemic Humility**: The AI knows when it’s out of its depth and defers to human judgment—because even AI has limits.
- **Transparency**: Clear explanations for every decision, so you’re never left wondering, “What was it thinking?”

It’s like giving your blockchain agent a philosophy degree and a conscience. Now, your AI can dream big *and* dream right.

**Fun Fact**: Kant once said, “Two things fill the mind with awe: the starry heavens above and the moral law within.” With Kantian Neural Dreams, we’ve added a third: ethically grounded AI on the blockchain.
